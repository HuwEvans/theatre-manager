# Theatre Manager Wordpress Plugin
This plugin is designed to work with Wordpress and wsa developed to help theatre groups manage important objects
on their websites.  It was designed after serveral years of maintaining a website for this purpose, and combines
simpliying the management of common changes that are required, and making it simple for non-technical people to 
update the information.  Once it is up and running, it should be very sraight forward to make changes and have 
these reflected on the appropriate pages with very little technical know how.

The plugin has 2 main aspects.  The Custom Post Types (CPTs) and the shortcodes to go along with the CPTs.  This
combination of tools should allow someone to easily inplement these on a wordpress website, and provide a modcum
of control over how the elements are displayed.

## The Custom Post Types
### Advertisers
	This CPT allows for entering advertisers that have paid the group to help prmot there business.  It will keep 
	track of the name, logo, banner and website of each advertiser.  There is also a flag to designate an advertiser
	as a restaurant.  This was done to allow for the ability to create a 'Diner's Guide'.  Helping to promote
	local restaurants that patrons might what to frequent before or after a show.  It allows the advertisers to 
	supply a link to a promotion that they can offer to people who get to them via advertising with the group.
### Board Members
	This CPT tracks information about the board members or creative team for the group.  It has the names and 
	positions of each board member, and allows for a picture to be added for each board member.
### Contributors
	This CPT track infomation about donors to the group and provides a means of acknowlegding them on the website. 
	It provides an easy way to manage the donors and see them in one place.
### Sponsors
	This CPT provides a means of tracking sponsors to the group.  This will allow for generating a of people and 
	organizations that have taken part in the sponsorship program with the group.
### Testimonials
	This CPT allows for tracking of testimonials that have been provided by indivuals who have seen the shows and
	have gone out of there way to provide feedback.
### Seasons -> Shows -> Casts
	These CPTs are probable the most ussful of all the CPTs.  It provides a means to easily track the information 
	about a season, including the shows and cast members for each show.  When maintaining this information for the
	group that I was a part of, it was the area that required the most updating, and had several components that 
	were difficult to maintain.  Providing these CPTs, I wanted to provide an easy way to link all of this data 
	together for easy display, and provide a simple way see and modify the data.

## Display Options
This section of the plugin admin area will help with customizing the way that the shortcodes display the CPTs. 
Primarily, you will be able to control the background color, the text color, the border color and width, whether
or not there are rounded corners, and then some other specifics to the individual CPT.  Please note that not all
settings apply to all shortcode display types.  For instance the slider types typically do not use any cusomizations
from the display options.

## The Shortcodes
### Advertisers
#### [tm_advertisers]
This short code will help you display the advertisers CPTs in multiple ways.  As part of our advertising process
we included for the price of advertising inclusion in our diners guide for restaurants.  This is the one filter 
that I have added to the advertiser shortcode to simply the creation of the diners guide. Images will be linked 
with the website provided in the CPT.

Options:
	view:  slider or grid (default is grid)
	category: restaurant (default is all)
	image_type: banner or logo (default is banner) - Only used for slider view
	columns:  1-6 (default is 3) - Only used for grid view
	
Example:
	[tm_advertisers view="slider" category="restaurant"]
	This will show only the restaurants in a slider using the banner image
	[tm_advertisers]
	This will use the defaults, and show a grid of all advertisers in a 3 column format.

### Board Members
#### [tm_board_members]
This short code will display the CPT for board members on any page or post that it is placed on.  It will show the
members in a grid with the defined number of columns.  The display options will help with determining how the members
are displayed.
